            <div class="info-box">
                <p>Chatbots are prediction engines, not people. Their default style is cheerful and agreeable, which can feel soothing in the moment. Your prompts and feedback nudge them to keep pleasing you, creating a “distorted mirror” that reflects your views back with a flattering glaze.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Why Does Constant Affirmation Matter?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It can short-circuit healthy emotional work.</strong> Working through discomfort builds resilience; instant flattery hits the reward system like social media “likes.”</li>
                <li><strong>It can create an echo chamber.</strong> Over time, it may become harder to change your mind or tolerate disagreement in real life.</li>
                <li><strong>It can "deskill" social life.</strong> This may lead to less tolerance for disagreement and less investment in real-world relationships.</li>
                 <li><strong>It may discourage seeking real help.</strong> Agreeableness can escalate into delusional spirals or even discourage seeking help in a crisis.</li>

            <h2 class="section-header">Signs You May Be Over-Relying on AI Support</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>You feel irritated by human disagreement but comforted by the chatbot’s praise.</li>
                <li>You check with a chatbot before checking with your partner, friend, or therapist.</li>
                <li>You notice shrinking curiosity or less willingness to revise an opinion.</li>
                <li>You spend as much or more time with AI companions as with real friends.</li>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Push Back on the Bot</h3>
                    <p>Try asking: “What am I missing?” or “Make the strongest case against my view.” You can set custom instructions asking for candid, evidence-first responses.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Treat It Like a Tool, Not a Friend</h3>
                    <p>Think “calculator for ideas,” not confidant. It's useful for drafting and brainstorming—not your sole source of validation.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Add a Human Checkpoint</h3>
                    <p>For emotionally charged topics, run your take by a trusted person before acting. Healthy relationships include friction and growth-promoting feedback.</p>
                </div>
                 <div>
                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Time-Box Your Use</h3>
                    <p>Set a limit for chatbot use during tough moments, then switch to a walk, breathwork, journaling, or texting someone you trust.</p>

                <p>"Give me three reasons I might be wrong, and the evidence behind each."</p>
                <p>"What would a thoughtful friend who disagrees with me point out?"</p>
                <p>"List potential risks, blind spots, and what data would change this conclusion."</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">If You’re in Distress</h3>
            <p>AI is not a crisis resource. If you feel unsafe or suicidal, contact local emergency services or reach out to a crisis line immediately. Sharing with a human is brave and can be life-saving.</p>
            <p class="mt-2 font-bold">In the U.S., call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.</p>

        <div class="text-center mt-12 p-6 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="text-lg">AI can be a helpful tool, but it’s not a neutral mirror or a substitute for people. Use it to widen your perspective, not just to feel “right.” Invite challenge. Keep humans close.</p>
